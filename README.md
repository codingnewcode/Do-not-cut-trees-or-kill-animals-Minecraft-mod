# Do-not-cut-trees-or-kill-animals-Minecraft-mod
Reviewing Java fundamentals following Kaupenjoe's pre Minecraft modding [Java lessons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1Egp6soRNlflWJWc44sau40)

This is a set of Java lessons i wanted to take in order to start my own Minecraft mod, i needed to refresh my Java knowledge since i hadn't coded for quite some time (a few years), and possibly explore if i would go into developping or maybe more generally IT career again.

It was a lot, the teacher was really engaging and i found the topics interesting. I finally decided not to go with the modding idea, but i found these lessons very instructive.

My idea was to create a mod where you had to survive on Minecraft without killing animals or cutting trees, hence adding new items in the game. I stopped this project, after completing all the lessons, partly because i was not vegetarian anymore, and later on i would start to cut some trees indirectly by buying them, even though i try to resort doing so if possible. This was also around Christmas time where lots of trees are cut which i find needless, as they are not used in furniture or eaten like animals we kill (or used in other parts even though not ideal it seems sometimes to be needed maybe but is my own opinion on the topic).

After that i went on a little coding break, until May 2024, date of which i am publishing this, but i wanted to reflect that i worked on this earlier. Hence i learned another thing which was fun to try too (even though a tiny bit scary in possibilities), to go back in time, at least in git commits.

# Change git commit date
This is very interesting because i wanted to show that i worked on this and wanted to learn this at the real date and time i did, which was January 2024, not current time which is May 2024.

So i followed some instructions i found online, and found other help and resources available already to successfully change the date i worked on this to be from 1st January 2024 to 26th January 2024:
- [reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/9kcc1r/how_can_i_change_the_date_on_a_commit_in_github/)
- which redirects to [codewithhugo.com's instructions](https://codewithhugo.com/change-the-date-of-a-git-commit/#set-the-date-of-the-last-commit-to-an-arbitrary-date)
- i needed to modify date and time to my own time's, which i found on the local files on my drive, then i needed to update codewithhugo's instruction's timezone to mine, which i found to be named CEST thanks to [timezones-list git](https://github.com/omsrivastava/timezones-list) which mentions [wikipedia timezones abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

I added a few [screenshots](./img) to document how i managed to do this, such as the one below.

VS Code preview allows me to add image files (pictures) with a local link and make sure the display works

All in all this experiment of January 2024, and htis new one in May 2024 changing date retroactively, really comforts me in the fact i enjoy always exploring new things, it's a lot of fun to tweak and create new stuff all the time, even though maybe be bit scary at first, but tweaking is a lot of fun, documenting it too, but tweaking too.
